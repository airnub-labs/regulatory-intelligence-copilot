# Documentation structure

This folder groups the core design documents and their historical versions by theme.

- **decisions/** – ADRs/decision logs with the latest `decisions_v_0_6.md` in the folder root and older versions in `decisions/versions/`.
- **roadmap/** – Roadmaps, with `roadmap_v_0_6.md` in the root and earlier milestones in `roadmap/versions/`.
- **phases/** – All phase plans, verification passes, and remediation notes (PHASE_* files).
- **change-detection/** – Change-detection specs; the active reference is `graph_change_detection_v_0_6.md` and earlier drafts live under `change-detection/archive/`.

Other top-level docs (e.g., `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`, `ESLINT_RULES.md`, `migration_plan_v_0_2.md`) remain alongside this README for quick access. Historical documents that predate the themed folders remain in `docs/archive/`.
