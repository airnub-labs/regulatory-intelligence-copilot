# Documentation structure

The documentation tree is organised around two primary domains:

- **architecture/** – Platform design, including the current architecture spec, graph model, timeline engine, safety, concept definitions, change detection, conversation context, and development notes.
- **governance/** – Decision logs, roadmap milestones, phase plans, migration plans, and product-facing specs (including scenario engine notes).
- **api/** – API-specific references.

See `documentation_restructure_plan.md` for the rationale behind this layout and how the former `docs/specs/` tree was merged into these folders.
