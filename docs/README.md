# Documentation structure

The documentation tree is organised by domain so related narratives, specs, and historical versions sit together.

- **architecture/** – Current architecture spec lives in `architecture_v_0_6.md`; earlier revisions are in `architecture/versions/`.
- **governance/** – Decision logs, roadmap milestones, phase plans, and migration plans.
- **graph/** – Graph schema, concept model, algorithms, seeding notes, and special jurisdiction modelling guidance.
- **engines/** – Timeline, scenario, conversation context, and change detection engines.
- **safety/** – Privacy boundaries plus ingress and egress guard designs.
- **product/** – User-facing product specs (e.g., Eligibility Explorer).
- **dev-notes/** – Developer setup, lint rules, and Node 24 materials.
- **archive/** – Legacy documents that predate the current structure.

See `documentation_restructure_plan.md` for the rationale behind this layout and how the former `docs/specs/` tree was merged into these folders.
