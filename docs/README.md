# Documentation structure

The documentation tree is organised around two primary domains:

- **architecture/** – Platform design, including the current architecture spec, graph model, engines, safety, concept definition, and developer notes.
- **governance/** – Decision logs, roadmap milestones, phase plans, migration plans, and product-facing specs.
- **api/** – API-specific references.
- **archive/** – Legacy documents that predate the current structure.

See `documentation_restructure_plan.md` for the rationale behind this layout and how the former `docs/specs/` tree was merged into these folders.
