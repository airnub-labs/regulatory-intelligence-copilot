# Graph

Graph model, schema, seeding materials, and concept definitions live together here.

- **graph-schema/** – Canonical schema (`graph_schema_v_0_6.md`) and changelog with historical versions retained in `versions/`.
- **concept/** – Concept model for the regulatory graph, including older revisions.
- **graph_algorithms_v_0_1.md** – Optional graph algorithm choices and how they are applied.
- **graph_seed_ni_uk_ie_eu.txt** – Seed data covering IE/UK/NI/EU jurisdictions.
- **special_jurisdictions_modelling_v_0_1.md** – Guidance for modelling IE/UK/NI/IM/GI/AD/CTA edge cases.

Use this folder as the single source for graph structure, evolution, and seeding guidance that other domains reference.
