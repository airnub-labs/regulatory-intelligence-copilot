## Why These Were Archived

1. **Consolidation**: Multiple overlapping documents were consolidated into a single authoritative reference
2. **Completion**: Implementation plans and status documents are no longer needed (100% complete)
3. **Bug Fixes**: Bug reports document issues that have been fully resolved
4. **Clarity**: A single canonical document is easier to maintain and reference
