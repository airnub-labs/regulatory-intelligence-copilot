# Development Docs

Guides and artefacts that support day-to-day development. Use this area for local setup notes and implementation plans; architectural decisions live under `../architecture/` and governance materials under `../governance/`.

- `local/` – local environment setup and linting guidance.
- `implementation-plans/` – phase and implementation planning documents.
