Historical architecture baselines preserved for comparison with the current v0.6 design.

Files:
- `architecture_v_0_1.md` – initial architecture outline.
- `architecture_v_0_2.md` – second iteration of the architecture.
- `architecture_v_0_3.md` – third iteration of the architecture.
- `architecture_v_0_4.md` – fourth iteration of the architecture.
- `architecture_v_0_5.md` – pre-v0.6 architecture snapshot.
- `architecture_diagrams_v_0_5.md` – diagrams accompanying the v0.5 architecture.
