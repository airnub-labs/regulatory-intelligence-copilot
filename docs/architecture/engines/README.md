# Engines

Execution engines that sit on top of the regulatory graph are grouped here.

- **timeline-engine/** – Timeline Engine spec and integration notes.

Change detection lives under `architecture/change-detection/`, conversation context under `architecture/conversation-context/`, and scenario-engine materials under `governance/product/` to keep future product use cases with their governance owners.

Start here when building or integrating runtime services that consume the graph schema and time logic.
