- `graph_schema_v_0_6.md` and `graph_schema_changelog_v_0_6.md` – current model and evolution.
- `graph_algorithms_v_0_1.md` – algorithmic guidance over the graph.
- `graph_change_detection_v_0_6.md` – change detection design folded into the graph domain.
- `graph_seed_ni_uk_ie_eu.txt` – initial seeding data for NI/UK/IE/EU.
- `special_jurisdictions_modelling_v_0_1.md` – modelling guidance for edge jurisdictions.
- `archive/` – prior schema versions, changelog history, and earlier change detection notes.
