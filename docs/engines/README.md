# Engines

Execution engines that sit on top of the regulatory graph are grouped here.

- **timeline-engine/** – Timeline Engine spec and integration notes.
- **scenario-engine/** – Scenario/what-if evaluation model and versions.
- **conversation-context/** – Concept capture tooling and server-managed conversation context spec.
- **change-detection/** – Change detection specs and archives for graph updates.

Start here when building or integrating runtime services that consume the graph schema.
