Privacy boundaries and guardrails for graph access and outbound calls live here.

- **data_privacy_and_architecture_boundaries_v_0_1.md** – What can and cannot enter the shared graph; PII boundaries.
- **safety-guards/** – Ingress and egress guard designs with current versions at the folder root and historical revisions in `versions/` where present.
