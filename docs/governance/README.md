# Governance

This folder groups decision records, roadmap milestones, phase plans, and migration notes so delivery governance lives in one place.

- **decisions/** – ADRs and decision logs with the latest version in the folder root and historical versions in `versions/`.
- **roadmap/** – Roadmaps and milestones, also versioned by folder.
- **phases/** – Implementation phases, verification passes, and remediation notes.
- **product/** – Product-oriented specs such as the Eligibility Explorer.
- **migration_plan_v_0_1.md** and **migration_plan_v_0_2.md** – Detailed migration plans for major releases.

Use this folder as the entry point for delivery status and historical decisions before diving into architecture or engine details.
