# Specs have moved

The detailed specs formerly stored under `docs/specs/` now live in the domain-first folders in `docs/`:

- Graph schema, concepts, algorithms, and seeding → `../architecture/graph/`
- Concept definition (top-level) → `../architecture/concept/`
- Timeline, scenario, conversation context, and change detection engines → `../architecture/engines/`
- Safety and privacy materials → `../architecture/safety/`
- Developer guides → `../architecture/dev-notes/`
- Product specs → `../governance/product/`
- Governance (decisions, roadmap, phases, migrations) → `../governance/`

Please update any bookmarks or references to use the new paths.
